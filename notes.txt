Maintenance

There is a line that refers to 63342 or 63343. This is the port that the IDE uses to run the app. This keeps changing. If this changes, I have to change one line in
code. The error message specifies what the new value should be.

Status

. GET and DELETE are more or less working. There is a lot of cleanup to do

Next Steps

. Post to Github
. Clean up
. DELETE AND PUT
. Study the code and understand
. Let the front end assign id or remove the need for id
. Error handling

Medium Priority Goals

. Persistence -- DB?
. Understand 63342/63343 changes.
. Code review

Low Priority Goals

. Learn to run from the directory, i..e, outside the IDE
. Learn to package the app
. Gradle?
. Jackson instead of Gson

NOTES

I am using only GSON (no JACKSON).
